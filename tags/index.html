      The objective is to develop a simple movie recommender model that leverages user-ratings to recommend unseen movies to the users. Based on the movie-rating patterns of users, different clusters are formed. Each cluster groups together users with similar movie choices and ratings. This knowledge is later used to provide personalized movie recommendations. The data is collected from MovieLens dataset (small), which contains 100,000 ratings of 9000 movies (rated by 600 users).

      A pdf reader that allows a blind person to read documents. The concept is to use the haptic touch on the screen and speak aloud the word on tap. This system provides some smart features e.g., dynamic scrolling, line checking and vibration notification for the line break. The system is built on the Android platform. The smart feature - dynamic scrolling leverages the phone gyroscope reading and can detect tilt. Based on the tilt angle it triggers the scrolling.

      Many measurements have been taken to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. Among which, wearing a face mask is one way to prevent spreading the virus. This work aims to detect if a person is wearing a mask or not. With this objective, a machine learning model is developed, which leverages transfer learning to detect mask. For collecting human faces with the mask, a subset (1000 images) of the MAFA dataset is used.

      Heart disease or Cardiovascular disease is one of the biggest causes of mortality (i.e., causing 1 out of 4 deaths in the US) among the population of the world. Therefore, prediction of Cardiovascular disease is considered one of the important subjects in clinical data analysis. However, several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, etc. lead to cardiac arrest. So, the purpose of this work is to predict if any patient has the chance of having heart disease or not.

However, when searching, users can find it difficult to assess whether a tutorial is designed for their level of expertise. TutVis stands for tutorial visualization, which is a Photoshop tutorial browsing system that provides auto-generated information to assist users in the tutorial searching and selection.

      The purpose of this project is to gain insights into the agricultural market data of different commodities, e.g., Wheat, Corn, Barley, Oats etc. and present them in a dashboard. The data includes different attributes such as consumption, production, import, export, stocks, yield of the commodities. The data reports attributes on 125 countries and over 20 years timeline.
 The UI supports responsive layouts. For developing the visualizations, PSD Grain Data_small.

      The objective of this project is to develop a dynamic dashboard in Tableau which can update the data source. The dataset for this visualization includes wheat consumption (domestic, fsi, feed dom., etc) in Canada over 20 years timeline.
 XAMPP is used to host the data in a local server. The data is fetched from the local server into Tableau. The Tableau dashboard presents a crosstab and a line chart of the time series data.

      The objective is to extract the registration/license plate number from different vehicle images. The task is divided into two parts. First, detect the possible ROI(region of interest) - in this case, it is the license plate of vehicles. Second, extract the letters and numbers from the detected region. To separate ROI from the images, object detection model - YOLO v4 is used. YOLO v4 (You only look once) is a family of one-stage object detectors that are fast (i.
