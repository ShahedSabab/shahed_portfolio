      <description>In the rapidly evolving fields of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm. By combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models, RAG systems can leverage vast information repositories to generate highly relevant and contextually rich responses. However, as the complexity and volume of data grow, the need for more advanced techniques becomes clear. This is where knowledge graphs play a pivotal role.</description>

      <description>Online text and video tutorials are among the most popular and heavily used resources for learning feature-rich software applications (e.g., Photoshop, Weka, AutoCAD, Fusion 360). However, when searching, users can find it difficult to assess whether a tutorial is designed for their level of expertise. TutVis stands for tutorial visualization, which is a Photoshop tutorial browsing system that provides auto-generated information to assist users in the tutorial searching and selection. The provided information is as follows: difficulty level (advanced/beginner), topics covered, length, text complexity, command usage ratio.</description>

      <description>Heart disease or Cardiovascular disease is one of the biggest causes of mortality (i.e., causing 1 out of 4 deaths in the US) among the population of the world. Therefore, prediction of Cardiovascular disease is considered one of the important subjects in clinical data analysis. However, several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, etc. lead to cardiac arrest. So, the purpose of this work is to predict if any patient has the chance of having heart disease or not.</description>

      <description>The objective of this project is to detect intent from texts. For this, a benchmark dataset is used, which includes 7 intents (Search Creative Work, get weather, Book Restaurant, Play Music, Add to Playlist, Rate Book, Search Screening Event) and 14 thousand samples. Transfer learning has been leveraged to train a machine learning model. The model takes the raw texts, which are tokenized and vectorized to feed into the pre-trained model.</description>

      <description>A security system for computers which runs as the background process and tracks keyboard or mouse inputs. Any unauthorized input triggers this system and sends a notification to the user’s phone through text messages (GSM). Users can use a mobile app (named Pointer Security) to see the live webcam feed, screen streaming and check who is using the computer and can send commands remotely through the app to either shut down or lock the computer.</description>
